# py-tracer via Pillow

**NOTE: You must have Pillow installed via PIP for this to work.**

This adapts my py-tracer engine to Pillow (fork of Python Imaging Library), to
provide a graphical display of the engine results.

A sphere rendering example can be run via:

`python spheretest.py`

Which will generate an image called "sphere.png" in this project directory.
